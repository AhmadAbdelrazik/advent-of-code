# Advent of Code Solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges from 2015 to 2023. Each day's challenge is solved using Go (Golang), with a focus on clean, efficient, and well-tested code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year's folder containing subfolders for each day's challenge. Each day's folder includes the following files:
- `main.go`: The implementation of the solution for the day's challenge.
- `main_test.go`: Unit tests for the solution to ensure correctness.
- `input.txt`: The input data provided by the problem (if applicable).

```

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or later

## Running the Solutions

To run the solution for a specific day's challenge, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will compile and run the `main.go` file, displaying the output of the solution.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for a specific day's challenge, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the following command:

```bash
go test
```

This will run all the tests in `main_test.go` and report any failures.
